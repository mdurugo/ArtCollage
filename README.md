# ArtCollage
In this project I am creating a collage of images by designing a digital image manipulation software to replicate digital image editing software.

The goal of this project is to perform several operations on digital images.

Your cellphone are computers with lenses and light-sensitive devices capable of capturing images in digital form, and your computer has photo-editing software that allows you to process those images. You can crop them, enlarge and reduce them, adjust the contrast, brighten or darken them, remove redeye, and a myriad of other operations. Many such operations are easy to implement, given a simple data type that captures the idea of a digital image.
